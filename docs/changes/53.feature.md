Improvement for learning and testing:

- add evaluation set to stereo regression (direction/energy) training and save it to joblib.

Add a stereo-regression training evaluation script to plot the training and evaluation metrics over the training iterations:

```console
python src/eventdisplay_ml/scripts/plot_training_evaluation.py --model_file tmp_cta_testing/stereo_south/dispdir_bdt.joblib --output_file test_training_curves.png
```

- set weights in training for energy bins with less than 10 counts to 10
