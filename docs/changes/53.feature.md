Fix critical bugs in stereo regression pipeline:

- **Fixed double log10 application**: E_residual was being computed with log10(ErecS) that had already been log10'd. Now ErecS/Erec remain in linear space during training/apply; log10 applied explicitly when needed.
- **Fixed energy bin weighting**: Bins with fewer than 10 events now correctly get zero weight instead of being clamped; weight sorting preserves bin order.
- **Fixed standardization inversion**: Added proper loading and validation of target_mean/target_std scalers in stereo apply pipeline to prevent KeyError crashes.
- **Fixed ErecS validation**: Safe log10 computation during apply avoids RuntimeWarning for invalid values; all output rows preserved even with invalid energy.
- **Fixed evaluation metrics**: ErecS in evaluation now properly converted to log10 space for energy resolution comparison.
- **Fixed FutureWarning**: Series positional indexing converted to numpy arrays for future pandas compatibility.

New features and improvements:

- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Added `test_regression_apply.py` with full unit test suite covering standardization inversion, residual computation, ErecS handling, and final prediction reconstruction.
- **Improved error messages**: Clear, actionable error messages when standardization parameters are missing or mismatched in apply pipeline.
- **Data preservation guarantee**: Stereo apply pipeline now preserves all input rows even when encountering invalid energy values, ensuring output count equals input count.
