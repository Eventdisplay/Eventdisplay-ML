Introduces telescope type handling for CTAO simulations by updating the stereo reconstruction pipeline to work with telescope-dependent variables across different telescope configurations. The key architectural change is moving from training separate models per telescope multiplicity (2, 3, 4 telescopes) to a single unified model that handles all multiplicities together. This is a major change applicable for both stereo and classification tasks.
